NOTE:  	W32DASM Ver 8.xx Series is designed for
	Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0.


Windows NT 3.51 users:

	W32Dasm will load and run in NT 3.51 provided that you
	install the Windows 95 IMAGEHLP.DLL file dated
	10/15/96 in the same directory as w32dsm89.exe.
	The IMAGEHLP.DLL that comes with NT 3.51 will not
	work.

	NOTE: Some Dialog control formats are not supported
	      in NT 3.51 and will result in improper control
	      display.

Windows W32s users:

	W32Dasm may load and run in some configurations of
	Windows 3.11 with W32s but the operation will be
	unpredicable.

1. fixes for MMX and certain 32 and 16 bit instruction decodes.

2. Added Code Patcher Assembler Feature (See Tutorial 11.0 in help file)

3. Added change indicators to the CPU registers and flag displays:

   	* CPU Register that change value from last instruction execute
	  appear as CAPITAL LETTERS ie eax -> EAX

	* CPU flags that changed from last instruction appear as
	  HIGHLIGHTED text

4. Added checkbox to force all rep instructions to "STEP THRU"
   even in "STEP INTO" mode.

5. Added enable/disable "Command Line Option Dialog Box" in Debugger Options.

6. Added "LPSYSTEMTIME" decode in API Details logic.

7. Undocumented New Feature: All Call and Jump Cross Reference Addresses may

	return to the reference, press F12.

8. Undocumented New Feature: There is a new button on the Lower Left Hand
